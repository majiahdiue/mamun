#
# This obfuscation dictionary contains names that are not allowed as file names
# in Windows, not even with extensions like .class or .java. They can however
# be used without problems in jar archives, which just begs to apply them as
# obfuscated class names. Trying to unpack the obfuscated archives in Windows
# will probably generate some sparks.
# Usage:
#     java -jar proguard.jar ..... -classobfuscationdictionary windows.txt
#                                  -packageobfuscationdictionary windows.txt
